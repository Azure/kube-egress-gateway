Update GatewayLBConfigurationReconciler for Go 1.25.0

This commit updates the GatewayLBConfigurationReconciler to use the new compatibility
layer for Go 1.25.0. The changes include:

1. Added a compatibility layer in pkg/compat that wraps the controller-runtime client
2. Updated the GatewayLBConfigurationReconciler to use this compatibility layer
3. Created a migration guide for updating other controllers

This is the first controller to be migrated to the Go 1.25.0 compatibility layer. 
The remaining controllers will be migrated in separate commits.

The compatibility layer addresses type parameter changes in Go 1.25.0 that affect
how controller-runtime's client API works with Kubernetes resources.
